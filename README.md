## Objective

This project is to simply display the fundamentals of Python. It makes use of a few basic programming concepts to print a username containing a city and a pet name. This is the first of many projects on my roadmap to Python Mastery.

- Python 3.12
  
## Steps
```
#print statement to introduce project
print("Welcome to my Simple Username Generator!")

#store birth city within a new variable
city= input("What city were you born in?\n")

#store pet name within a new variable
pet_name= input("What would name a new pet if you got one today?\n")

#print the new username
print("Your new username is: " + city + pet_name + "!\nVenture into the unknown!")

```
